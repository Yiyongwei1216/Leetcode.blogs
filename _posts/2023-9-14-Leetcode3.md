## Day3!

Yesterday cause the heavy flu, I cannot keep solving the problems. But now I am back!
Today still two questions.
The first one is 14. Longest Common Prefix:

Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

 

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"
Example 2:

Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.

I tried the solution called Approach 1: Horizontal scanning

My code are as following:
```
class Solution:
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
            
        prefix = strs[0]
        for i in range(1, len(strs)):
            while not strs[i].startswith(prefix):
                prefix = prefix[:-1]
                if not prefix:
                    return ""
                
        return prefix
```

The second question is: 13. Roman to Integer
Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "III"
Output: 3
Explanation: III = 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "LVIII"
Output: 58
Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.
Example 3:

Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

My solution is: 

```
class Solution:
    def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:
        m = {
            'I': 1,
            'V': 5,
            'X': 10,
            'L': 50,
            'C': 100,
            'D': 500,
            'M': 1000
        }

        ans = 0

        for i in range(len(s)):
            if i < len(s) -1 and m[s[i]] < m[s[i+1]]:
                ans -= m[s[i]]
            else:
                ans += m[s[i]]

        return ans
```
Using a hash map to solve this problem. Also don't forget to compare which one roman is in higher position. We can use -1 + 10 to represent IX and 10 + 1 to represent XI
